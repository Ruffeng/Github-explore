## Ruben Suet Cover letter for Github
I was thrilled to locate the Senior Front End Engineer position for the
Marketing team at GitHub. I could explain how much I admire the
enterprise since the first commit happened in 2007. The impact and
value that GitHub brings to the Engineering community day by day,
making collaboration so easy and simple with an open-source
mentality that brings pride to our career. However, that’s probably
what the other applicants will explain as well. So I would like to
explain why can I be the best fit to join your amazing team.


In your job offer, it says you are looking for a visually minded
front-end engineer with expertise in the design and development
process, that can work alongside with other engineers and your
Design team. I consider myself a perfect fit for this role since I
started developing back in 2007, so I grow up with GitHub. I learned
all that I know in close collaboration with product designers, such a
close collaboration that I’m married with a UX Designer, and we’ve
been together for 13 years! So when we talk about “Pixel Perfect” I
really DO KNOW what does this means, and how important a pixel
can be. In 2011 I decided to take a short detour and study a Degree
in Psychology. This experience was crucial for me to understand
how humans behave in a group, what helps a team to succeed, and
how to communicate better. This helped me to understand better all
the business requirements that sometimes Devs are not so happy
about, and how to communicate successfully with Stakeholders.


As a FrontEnd Engineer in MediaMarktSaturn, I successfully
managed to dynamize and bring the new Personalized experience
life, and bring a fresh Mediterranean “Talk less, do more” perspective
in the German way of working that helped to speed up the Tech
Transformation that the company is experiencing.


Working in the Marketing team of GitHub would be an honor for me.
I really enjoy bringing components life and working closely with the
Desing Team to create a valuable Design System that can be
scalable, easily maintained and to be proud of.

You can check out [my proposal on how to improve the Github experience](Contribution.md).

Would you have time for a brief chat in the next few days? I would
love to talk about how I can help to achieve these goals, creating a
positive impact and being part of the creative culture as it’s GitHub.

Sincerely,
Rubèn Suet.
